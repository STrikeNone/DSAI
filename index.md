## Welcome to Yi Hao's Portfolio. I am a Year 1 student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

(For my reference) [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/STrikeNone/Data-Science-/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files. I hope this page will be able to also reveal my growth and knowledge in Data Science.

[First Project](https://github.com/STrikeNone/Data-Science-/blob/main/Mini%20Project.ipynb) This is my first ever project in Data Science. I used a simple Decision Tree classifier to try and predict whether customers were going to leave a bank. 

[Second Project](https://github.com/STrikeNone/Data-Science-/blob/main/Movie_Recommender.ipynb) This is my attempt at creating a simple recommender for movies. I used Count Vectorizers (which is like encoding words from my understanding and applied to NLP) on selected features and then applied Cosine Similarity on them in order to determine, the closest movies. The dataset i used was [Dataset](https://github.com/STrikeNone/Data-Science-/blob/main/IMDB%20Movies.csv) and the [Youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueKXSupHz6Q&ab_channel=ComputerScience) that i referenced to.

[Third Project](https://github.com/STrikeNone/DSAI/blob/main/Special%20Challenge%201.ipynb) Using Advertisement Sale Price Dataset from Kaggle, i attempt to use a Linear Regression Model to predict the Sale Price. I attempted both Uni and Multi-Variate Linear Regression and did some Exploratory Analysis on the Dataset as well. The Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ashydv/advertising-dataset).
