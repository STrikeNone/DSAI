## Welcome to Yi Hao's Portfolio. I am a Year 1 student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. I hope this page will be able to also reveal my growth and knowledge in Data Science.

(For my reference) [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/STrikeNone/Data-Science-/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

[First Project](https://github.com/STrikeNone/Data-Science-/blob/main/Mini%20Project.ipynb) This is my first ever project in Data Science. I used a simple Decision Tree classifier to try and predict whether customers were going to leave a bank.
